# Apply-Lightweight-Fine-Tuning-to-a-Foundation-Model
# Project Overview
In my project "Apply Lightweight Fine-Tuning to a Foundation Model," I focused on adapting large pre-trained models efficiently using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This approach allowed me to customize foundation models for specific tasks without requiring extensive computational resources. I used the Hugging Face PEFT library, combined with PyTorch, to demonstrate the practical application of these techniques.

Key Objectives
The project covered several critical steps in the training and inference process, including:

Loading a Pre-trained Model: Selecting and loading a suitable pre-trained model from the Hugging Face model repository.
Evaluating the Model's Performance: Conducting an initial performance evaluation on a chosen sequence classification task to establish a performance baseline.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning: Applying a PEFT technique to fine-tune the pre-trained model for the specific task.
Performing Inference: Using the fine-tuned model for inference and comparing its performance against the original model.
Project Execution
1. Model Selection and Initial Evaluation
Model Choice: I selected a model compatible with sequence classification tasks. I chose GPT-2 for its smaller size and compatibility, though any suitable model from the Hugging Face library can be used.
Loading the Model: I loaded the chosen model into my notebook along with the corresponding tokenizer.
Dataset Selection: I chose an appropriate dataset for sequence classification from the Hugging Face datasets library. I ensured the dataset was manageable within the computational limits of my environment.
Initial Evaluation: I evaluated the pre-trained model's performance using an appropriate metric, setting a baseline for comparison after fine-tuning.
2. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
Creating a PEFT Configuration: I defined a PEFT configuration with suitable hyperparameters for my chosen model. I used the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique due to its broad compatibility and efficiency.
Building a PEFT Model: I integrated the PEFT configuration with the foundation model to create a PEFT model.
Training the Model: I executed a training loop with the PEFT model using the selected dataset. I ensured the loop ran for at least one epoch.
Saving the Model: I saved the trained model using the save_pretrained method to preserve my progress.
3. Inference and Performance Comparison
Loading the Fine-Tuned Model: I loaded the trained PEFT model using the appropriate class from the Hugging Face library.
Evaluating the Fine-Tuned Model: I performed a final evaluation of the fine-tuned model using the same metrics and dataset as the initial evaluation.
Performance Comparison: I compared the performance results of the fine-tuned model with those of the original pre-trained model to assess improvements.
Results and Conclusion
Upon completion, I demonstrated the ability to fine-tune a large foundation model efficiently using PEFT techniques. The final comparison between the original and fine-tuned models highlighted the effectiveness of the PEFT approach in improving model performance on a specific task without extensive computational overhead.

By following these steps, I gained hands-on experience with advanced model fine-tuning techniques and the practical use of the Hugging Face and PyTorch libraries, enhancing my skills in modern machine learning practices.
